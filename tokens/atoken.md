# AToken

## AToken

aTokens are tokens minted and burnt upon _supply_ and _withdraw_ of assets to an Aave market, which denote the amount of crypto assets supplied and the yield earned on those assets. The aTokensâ€™ value is pegged to the value of the corresponding supplied asset at a 1:1 ratio and can be safely stored, transferred or traded. All yield collected by the aTokens' reserves are distributed to aToken holders directly by continuously increasing their wallet balance.

## EIP20 Methods

All standard EIP20 methods are implemented for aTokens, such as `balanceOf`, `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve`, `totalSupply` etc.

ðŸ’¡ \`balanceOf\` will always return the most up to date balance of the user, which includes their principal balance + the yield generated by the principal balance.

## EIP712 Methods

### DOMAIN\_SEPARATOR

`function DOMAIN_SEPARATOR()`

Get the domain separator for the token at current chain.

### nonces

`function nonces(address owner)`

Returns the nonce value for address specified as parameter. This is the nonce used when calling `permit()`

```jsx
const token = new Contract(aTokenAddres, aToken.abi, provider);
await token.nonces(user);
```

## Aave Protocol View Methods

### scaledBalanceOf

`function scaledBalanceOf(address user)`

Returns the scaled supply balance of `user`. The scaled balance is the sum of all the updated stored balance divided by the reserve's liquidity index at the moment of the update.

### getScaledUserBalanceAndSupply

`function getScaledUserBalanceAndSupply(address user)`

Returns the scaled balance of the user and the scaled total supply.

### scaledTotalSupply

`function scaledTotalSupply()`

Returns the scaled total supply of the _aToken_.

### getPreviousIndex

`function getPreviousIndex(address user)`

Returns last index interest that was accrued to the user's balance (expressed in ray).

### getIncentivesController

`function getIncentivesController()`

Returns the address of the Incentives Controller contract

### POOL

`function POOL()`

Returns the address of the associated Pool for the _aToken._

### UNDERLYING\_ASSET\_ADDRESS

`function UNDERLYING_ASSET_ADDRESS()`

Returns address of the underlying reserve asset.

### RESERVE\_TREASURY\_ADDRESS

`function RESERVE_TREASURY_ADDRESS()`

Returns address of the Aave Treasury, controlled by governance, receiving the fee on this _aToken._

## Aave Protocol Write Methods

### setIncentivesController

`function setIncentivesController(IAaveIncentivesController controller)`

Sets a new Incentives Controller.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Only Pool Admin can call this methods. To update Incentives Controller on main Aave market, Governance Proposal must be submitted.
{% endhint %}

### permit

Allows a user to permit another account (or contract) to use their funds using a signed message. This enables gas-less transactions and single approval/transfer transactions.

## FAQ

*   How aToken earn interest? / How aToken balance increases?

    [LendingPool](https://www.notion.so/LendingPool-990bd1490c2a4a038c139c974835332b) methods (deposit, withdraw, borrow, repay, liquidationCall) updates the state and cumulated liquidity index of the reserve once every block. AToken's `balanceOf` method returns the balance computed based on `block.timestamp` and `liquidityIndex` of the underlying reserve and hence, returns the most up to date balance of account, which includes `principal + interest.`
* LiquidityRate vs LiquidityIndex
*   Can I transfer aTokens?

    Yes! with few caveat to keep in mind

    * By transferring aTokens, youâ€™re transferring your balance of the underlying asset. Only the account holding the aTokens can `withdraw` the deposited asset.
    * AToken transfer will fail if the resulting Health Factor of `user` will end up being below 1.
*   If I transfer aToken does my pending liquidity rewards get transferred?

    No, liquidity rewards earned prior to the transfer of aToken are accrued by the user/address holding the aTokens originally. Though, all future liquidity rewards will be earned by the new recepient.
* What is the difference between ScaledBalance and Balance?
*   Example please!

    Letâ€™s say you supply 1,000 DAI to the Aave [LendingPool](https://www.notion.so/LendingPool-990bd1490c2a4a038c139c974835332b), you will receive 1,000 aDAI (at 1:1 exchange rate).

    You can see your aDAI balance increasing right away.

    Now, say a month later your aDAI balance is 1,050. You could withdraw 1,050 DAI from LendingPool by burning 1050 aDAI.
