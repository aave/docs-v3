# Multiple Rewards and Claim

## Multiple Rewards and Claim

In Aave Protocol V2, Aave Governance activated liquidity mining rewards through a community proposal. While emissions of rewards differ per asset, the rewards were all denominated in `stkAave` tokens. Aave Protocol V3 offers option to have _**multiple rewards**_ per token. Now, it is possible for an asset listing to enable additional incentive rewards denominated in their protocol tokens.

V3 also allows user to claim rewards to another account as well as self and to claim multiple types of rewards per asset in single tx.

The [RewardsController](../periphery-contracts/rewardscontroller.md) contract is the main contract where the user interacts to claim the rewards of their positions. The users can claim all the rewards or an individual reward per transaction, with a variety of functions that allow more granularity at claim.

## Integration Guide

### Prerequisites

User(s) should already have a position in the protocol. Depending on the market and incentives that are enabled, they should already have a _supply_, _borrow or both_ in one of the incentivised assets.

### Check rewards enabled

To get list of rewards available for the given asset, use the `getRewardsByAsset()` method, passing in the associated _a/s/vToken_ address of the incentivised asset. Use `getRewardsData()` to get details per reward per asset.

```typescript
const aDaiRewardsList = await rewardsController.getRewardsByAsset(aDaiAddress);

const aDaiRewardOneData = await rewardsController.getRewardsData(
        aDaiAddress,
        rewardOneAddress
    );
```

### Check User(s) reward balance

You can get user reward balance for a given reward token or all reward tokens for a given list of assets using `getUserRewardsBalance()` or `getAllUserRewardsBalance()` respectively.

```typescript
const unclaimedUserRewards = await rewardsController.getUserRewardsBalance(
        [aDai.address, aWeth.addresss],
        userAddress,
        stkAave.address
      );

const [, allUnclaimedRewards] = await rewardsController.getAllUserRewardsBalance(
        [aDai.address, aWeth.address],
        userAddress
      );
```

### Claim Rewards

Claim one or all type of rewards _to self_, _another address_ or _onBehalf of an address_ (only authorised claimers) for a given assets list.

#### Self

User can claim one or all type of rewards using `claimRewardsToSelf()` and `claimAllRewardsToSelf()` respectively for the list of assets passed to the method.

{% hint style="info" %}
The `msg.sender` must match the user's address that has accrued the rewards.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

```tsx
// claims only stkAave for asset list [aDai, aWETH, ]
const claimStkAave = await rewardsController.claimRewardsToSelf(
        [aDai.address, aWETH.address, ],
        amountToClaim,
        stkAave.address
      );

// claims all reward types for asset list [aDai, aWETH, ]
const claimAllRewards = await rewardsController.claimAllRewardsToSelf(
				[aDai.address, aWeth.address, ]
			);
```

#### `onBehalfOf` An Address

Authorised user/contract addresses can claim one or all type of rewards _onBehalfOf,_ the user accruing rewards, using `claimRewardsOnBehalf()` and `claimAllRewardsOnBehalf()` respectively for the list of assets passed to the method.

{% hint style="info" %}
The `msg.sender` must be an authorised claimer set using setClaimer() method, via Governance Vote.
{% endhint %}

```tsx
// claims only stkAave for asset list [aDai, aWETH, ]
const claimStkAaveOnBehalfOf = await rewardsController.claimRewardsOnBehalf(
          [aDai.address],
          MAX_UINT_AMOUNT,
          userWithRewards.address,
          claimer.address,
          stkAave.address
        )

// claims all reward types for asset list [aDai, aWETH, ]
const claimAllRewardsOnBehalfOf = await rewardsController.claimAllRewardsOnBehalf(
                    [aDai.address],
                    userWithRewards.address,
                    claimer.address
		)
```

#### To Another Address

User can claim one or all type of rewards, to an external account (i.e. an account which may or may not be accruing the rewards being claimed), using `claimRewards()` and `claimAllRewards()` respectively for the list of assets passed to the method.

{% hint style="info" %}
The `msg.sender` must match the user's address that has accrued the rewards
{% endhint %}

```tsx
// claims only stkAave for asset list [aDai, aWETH, ] to receivingAccunt
const claimStkAave = await rewardsController.claimRewards(
        [aDai.address, aWETH.address, ],
        amountToClaim,
	receivingAccount.address
        stkAave.address
      );

// claims all reward types for asset list [aDai, aWETH, ] to receivingAccunt
const claimAllRewards = await rewardsController.claimAllRewards(
				[aDai.address, aWeth.address, ],
				receivingAccount.address
			);
```
